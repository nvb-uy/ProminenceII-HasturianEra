### :compass: Built on Custom Content

*Prominence is a modpack built on Custom Content, and based on its own lore universe.*

It focuses on balance while providing feature rich RPG content. Unlike other RPG modpacks, Prominence also features tech mods, which are optional paths players may take for their utility, you can still play through all of the campaign without having to touch tech mods. 

Why tech in an RPG? Because in the universe of Prominence, you are a mere traveler from another dimension coming to an already developed universe, with civilizations ranging from the stone age up to highly technological kingdoms. You decide to forge your own path, as the Flameborn of Vaaz.
