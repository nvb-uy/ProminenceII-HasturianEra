## Prominence II RPG: Hasturian Era
**3.1.0hf - The Great Artifact & Enchanting Update**

![Update Banner](https://github.com/nvb-uy/cdn/blob/main/update-images/prominence-2-rpg/3.1.0.png?raw=true)

This update is the biggest update since v3.0, featuring two new artifacts: Orion (for Archers) and Vaazkar (for Tanks). It also introduces many fixes and new features, such as new questlines (Botania, Spell Tutorial), 3 New Archer Spellbooks, Tiered Spellbooks, Enchanting Limits, new Armor Sets, new Improved Shield Mechanics, leveled bosses now interacting with the player's level, and much more, I invite you to read the whole changelog! 

Initially this version was going to be 3.0.50, but due to the high amount of impactful changes it has been renamed to v3.1.0.
You can expect the Cinderstone Depths Update to release on v3.2 instead!

**TOMS STORAGE HAS BEEN REMOVED.** You will NOT lose your items, but the existing storage network blocks will disappear. Please follow the AE2 questline to make a storage network.

# Important Changes
- **Orion, Hunter of the Stars.** The new, long awaited artifact for Rangers, featuring three unique paths with different gameplay styles.
- **Vaazkar, Protector of the Molten City.** A new shield artifact for tanks, focused towards crowd control and team utility.
- **3 New Archer Spellbooks:** Mintaka's Fright, Alnilam's Sight, Alnitak's Might. They are also the first three Tier III spellbooks, which have a recipe instead of being obtainable in the spell binding table.
- **Enchantment Limits.** Items now can only have up to 6 enchantments. With the exception of unique-tier items having a limit of 8, and artifacts having a limit of 10. In the future you will be able to increase this limit with an item!
- **Tiered Spellbooks.** With the introduction of the new archer spellbooks, various more advanced spellbooks have been promoted to Tiered spellbooks. These books need to be crafted as they cannot be obtained through the Spell Binding Table. There's a questline explaining this!
- **New Armor Sets.** Netherite upgrade sets for Wizards, Archers, Warriors, Rogues, Priests, Paladins and Death Knight armor sets!
- **Decaying Death Knights & Blood Mini-Rework.** Decaying enchantment now works as intended, and Blood Death Knights had a mini-rework with Blood Plague now healing the player based on their blood power.
- **Leveled Campaign Bosses.** Campaign bosses' level requirement now interacts with your actual level; if you're lower level you will deal less damage depending on how much the level difference is. Some bosses, like The Faceless, have a strict requirement and will require you to be their level to deal any significant damage. This requirement is marked in each of their quests at the top.
