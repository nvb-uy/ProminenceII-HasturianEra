# Prominence II: Hasturian Era v3.9.4
**Sir Scar Crow - Halloween Event!**

Happy Halloween! This update introduces a new halloween event, and boss, called **Sir Scar Crow**, with its own mythic version, playable until November 12th (Nov 14th for the mythic version).
Not just a boss - also find a new unique weapon, the **Scarred Night**, and a new transmog appearance, the **Pumpmourne, Blade of the Haunted Pumpkin**. Both obtainable as a chance from the mythic version of Sir Scar Crow.

**To summon the normal version of Sir Scar Crow, follow the questline "Spookiness in the air", which will be automatically unlocked once you join your world.**

Ok sorry it's not just that, Unholy Death Knights also got a terrifying buff, fits the theme, doesn't it?

## Important Changes
- **Seasonal Events.** This is the start of a new trend in Prominence II, seasonal events. This updates adds the "Scarred Night" Halloween event, playable only through October 20th to November 12th, featuring a boss (+ mythic variant) and a small questline to get to the boss.
- **Unholy Death Knight Buff.** A full buff for Unholy Death Knights! They were one of the worst classes previously and unperformed by a lot compared to Frost, so this buff aims to make it more viable in the late game.
- **Small Holy Builds Buff.** Many weapons now give holy power and have the Smite spell by default, making paladin's gear options broader.

## Changes
- Added new boss; Sir Scar Crow, with a mythic variant, exclusive to the halloween event.
- Added new unique weapon exclusive to the halloween event; Scarred Night. Obtianable through the killing of mythic Sir Scar Crow, with a 40% chance.
