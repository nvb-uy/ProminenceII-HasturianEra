# Prominence II: Hasturian Era
v3.9.8 - Esentially Enchanting!

This Update fixes the rarities of the Enchants. Protection, Sunfire and Sharpness as well as many other can now be acquired easier if you max out your Enchanting Table. The Enchanting bloat has been reduced and Enigma Resonator has been reintroduced. Added Excavators

But not just that! It also introduces the addition of the highly requested Essential Mod, which adds cosmetics, a friend system, screnshot sharing, world sharing and more! Buying Essential cosmetics will directly support the project as we get an affiliate from it!
