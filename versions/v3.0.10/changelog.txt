# Prominence II RPG: Hasturian Era
**3.0.10 - Health Overhaul & Blood Death Knights**

This update brings two new big things: A new tank class; the Blood Death Knight. And most importantly, a health overhaul.

From now on, players will start gaining max HP based when they level up. Enemy damage was adjusted and the max hp given by gear and talents was too; the S'kellak's Blessing fate now grants +100 Max HP.

For more info about this, read the [blog post that explains these changes](https://rpg.prominence.wiki/blog/3.0.10-changes)

## Important Changes
- **Health Overhaul**: Players will now gain health each level. Talents and armor sets have been adjusted to better suit tank builds, and damage was re-adjusted.
- **Blood Death Knights**: The new tank class of Blood Death Knights is out! A self sustain focused tank class. Jewelry & Runeaxes aren't implemented yet!
- **New Frostmourne Model**: A new model for the Frostmourne artifact has been forged.
- **Healing!**. Due to the new health adjustments, healers are in a better state and even needed for multiplayer. For singleplayer, there were consumable buffs, like the Health Flask now healing 10% max health + 35% of maximum health over 10s!
- **Healthbars**. The hearts in the HUD have been completely replaced with a healthbar, so it's easier to see your HP in later stages 
- **PvP**: Thanks to the new HP changes, PvP is in a better state in the late/end game. It still is not fully balanced, but a PvP focused update will come in the future.
