# Prominence II: Hasturian Era v3.9.3
**v3.9.3 - Overhauled Tiers, More Reforging, MYTHIC LOOT!?**

As the name suggests, this update introduces changes to tiers! From overhauled tiers (especially shields) to allowing the reforging of non-reforgeable items, to mythic items spawning on loot and crafting! 

## Changes
- Very big changes to Item Tiers:
  - Mythic gear can now be crafted and found in loot
  - Shield tiers were reworked to match armor values, to have them as a "5th armor piece"
  - Removed offhand from valid equipment slots for bows to prevent dual wielding exploiting for unnatural ranged stat buffs
  - Made various previously non-reforgeble items now reforgeble
  - Changed many of the stats given by tiers, you can see them [on this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qPMfS5KAMPM2X_8mP73K6M1aN07oDymGpewoeGihuK8)
- Feral claws have been removed (finally) from loot.
- Fixed crash where villagers opening doors could have a chance of crashing the game.
- Changed window title of the modpack
