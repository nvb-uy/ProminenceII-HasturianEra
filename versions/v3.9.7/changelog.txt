# Prominence II: Hasturian Era v3.9.7
**Simply More Stuff!**

This small update focuses on unique items from Simply Swords. It fixes the chances of unique weapon drops, overhauls the questline (Ty alm!) and now many of the campaign bosses can drop unique weapons.

Enjoy the new questline filled with references, easter eggs, and of course lots of rewards! Even smaller quests to get specific weapons like the Molten Core (Yes! Fyr'alath will be easier to make)
