# Prominence II: Hasturian Era v3.1.53
**Stability Update & Spanish Translations**

This update brings mostly stability changes and bug fixes, but also a new step forward into supporting Spanish translations for the modpack. There is also a full chinese translation in the works by another team, but this one will not be added officially into the pack until v3.2 drops, due to heavy changes required.

While the modpack is not yet 100% translated in other languages, mod support will start to be covered in the next few updates, hopefully by v3.2 the modpack should be fully translated in Spanish and Chinese.

If you wish to help translate the modpack into another language, please hit me up with a DM!
