## Prominence II RPG: Hasturian Era
**3.0.20 - Leveling Progression Overhaul**

![Update Banner](https://github.com/nvb-uy/cdn/blob/main/update-images/prominence-2-rpg/3.0.20.png?raw=true)

This update changes the progression of player leveling to make it easier for players to progress through the campaign. As players who didn't focus on doing the campaign right away would reach high levels and then face the early bosses with high scaling, making them way more difficult than they should be.

*If you were level 11 or higher and didn't defeat the Night Lich, then your level will be set back to 10! Same applies to players who didn't finish Void's Invasion and were a higher level than 50.*

## Important Changes
- **Stage Leveling**. Leveling is now locked behind the content being made. By default players now can level up to level 10, and will unlock 11-50 leveling after defeating the first boss of Void's Invasion. 51-65 leveling is now unlocked once starting Hasturian Era.
- **Dual choices for first boss**. Now the Night Lich is one of the options as the first boss of Void's Invasion, with the other now being the Decaying King. This means that to progress through campaign you can either kill the Night Lich in the Overworld, or Decaying King in the Nether. The Decaying King was buffed to be immune to ranged options, making it a boss option focused towards melee, making it the opposite of Night Lich.
- **Level Indicators**. Bosses will now have level indicators, displaying what level they are.
