# Prominence II RPG: Hasturian Era
**v3.1.20 - The Eldritch Eye & Co-Op Leveling**

This update introduces a new boss replacement for the eye, called The Eldritch Eye. A fully custom boss that is both ranged and melee friendly, it's quite big tho.

Besides that, changes to leveling where made to allow Co-Op leveling to become possible, and reducing the farming of XP via XP builds that previously existed to favor players that were losing XP by doing co-op.

## Boss Changes
- Replaced "The Eye" boss with the new "The Eldritch Eye" boss.

## Player Level Changes
- Experience is now shared with all players that participate on the kill, instead of only the player that did the last blow, making Co-Op leveling possible.
- Level XP gain now has 3x less weight on dropped experience but an increase from max health by 40%
- Minimum leveling experience increased from 220 to 250
- Reduced leveling experience increase factor by 0.005 (per level) 
- Fixed funny glitch where breaking an armor stand would give you 4 leveling xp

## Other Changes
- Fixed resistance effect making armor reductions to not work
- Reduced Ancient Knowledge strength by 50%
- Disabled Charm of Ancient knowledge
- Replaced all lunapixel related things with the new Cinderstone Studios equivalents
- Removed Essential hard coded crash & warning screen
