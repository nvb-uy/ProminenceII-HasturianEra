# Prominence II Hasturian Era v3.1.52
**New Models & Textures**

This update introduces mostly visual changes, namely a new model for the artifact A'zhar, and new models for unique tier weapons, along with hundreds of new textures supported by Ashen. But it also fixes bugs such as the enchant limit bug that the previous version introduced.
