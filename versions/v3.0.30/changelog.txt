## Prominence II RPG: Hasturian Era
**3.0.30 - Tutorial Quests & Questline Overhauls**

This update introduces a lot of questline changes, new tutorial questlines explaining basic information (Including building yourself and how stats work), along some special things like Eternal Challenges and a slight Inventory UI Overhaul.

Initially was going to be v3.0.50, also adding the two remaining artifacts Orion and Vaazkar. But due to time issues I've split it into two.

## Important Changes
- **Quest Overhaul.** Overhauled questlines, over a hundred new quests, and more.
- **Tutorials.** Among the new additions, tutorial questlines were added that include important info, such as how to build yourself, what stats are and how they work, etc.
- **Cosmetic Aritfacts.** Cosmetic versions of artifacts are now obtainable through Eternal Challenges (see below), used for Transmogrification.
- **Eternal Challenges.** New hard and hidden quests which serve as easter eggs, completing some will unlock a hint towards the next. These will get expanded upon with future updates, unlocking even whole secret questlines.
- **Inventory GUI Overhaul.** A clean new look for the inventory! Featuring less clutter, and a sidebar with useful buttons.
- **Tips.** Added tips and lore fun facts in the loading screen and esc menu!
