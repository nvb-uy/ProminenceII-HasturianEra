# Prominence II RPG: Hasturian Era
**v3.1.10 - "Not The Last" Artifact Update**

## Important Changes
- **New Artifact: Gh'aj, The Living Blade.** A dagger artifact meant for fast attacking rogue builds. Don't listen to its whispers.
- **New Artifact: Apophis, The Divine Hand.** A dual-wielded hammer artifact made for Paladins or Priests that aren't scared of going melee.
- **Translatable Artifacts.** The abilities, descriptions and other misc additions that were previously hardcoded are now translatable using resource packs!

## Next Update Spoilers
||The Eye boss is getting a complete remake, replacing it with a fully custom boss. I am aware of the issues that the current Eye boss has, so my solution will be to completely replace it with a new boss with better mechanics. Stay tuned, as this will release before the Vaaz update. Soon:tm:||

## Scaling Changes
- Fixed scaling being based on the talent points spent instead of the player's level, fixing talent reset cheeses
- Fixed corruption scaling with some abilities not being capped
- Reduced strength of corruption on active talents by -20%

## Artifact Changes
- Artifact tooltips and abilities are now translatable (Check latest en_us.json for reference)
- Fixed Fury of a Thousand Fists not proccing the soulfire damage when Enrage is active.
