# Prominence II RPG v3.0.2
**Player Damage Increase**

Due to scaling being harsh in the early game, this update focuses on buffing the player, specially in the early game, to ease out starting the modpack. Players who don't have good builds will also benefit from it, being now strong enough to go through the campaign (and even low tier mythic bosses).

Specifically, the rebalancing introduced in v2.0.0 was reworked to no longer have stamina hits (First hits being stronger than the rest) and the global -50% damage reduction was removed, due to this, technically damage was also nerfed (scaling is a lot stronger) but due to the player having double damage now, the end game damage is really similar.

For those who liked the difficulty from 3.0.1 and 3.0.0, I am planning on adding new features into difficulties later on, and adding the same scaling as an optional feature.

## Balance Changes
These damage changes affect mostly the early game, making it less punishing, while also affecting the endgame similarly to how it was previously (and has been since the v2.0.0 update released last year)
