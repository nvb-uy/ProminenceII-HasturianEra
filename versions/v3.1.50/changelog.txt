# Prominence II RPG: Hasturian Era
**v3.1.50 - An 8M Download Special**

Thank you for 8 million downloads! This is by far the biggest update the modpack has had since v3.0, featuring thousands of changes, but most importantly thousands of bug fixes, crash fixes, and QoL changes. It also features a big improvement on both performance and a big reduction loading times, along with fixes to lag spikes.

But not only that! Also see those new sexy health & stamina bars.

**PLEASE MAKE A BACKUP BEFORE UPDATING, JUST IN CASE! OLD WORLDS ARE STILL COMPATIBLE BUT BETTER BE SAFE THAN SORRY.**

Updates from now on will be smaller than usual, as I am focusing fully on v3.2's development. See you in Vaaz soon, Flameborn.

## Important Changes
- **Heavy performance improvements.** Performance can be seen improved heavily in clients, and possibly servers too (Not enough data yet)
- **Big reduction in loading times.** Loading times have been reduced by ~40%, possibly having a higher impact on lower end PCs.
- **Fixed lag spikes.** Various lag spikes such as when opening the questbook for the first time have been fixed.
- **Thousands of misc fixes.** Yes, you've read that right, THOUSANDS of fixes across all of the modpack, from bugs to crashes, lots!
- **Transmoggable Backpacks.** What lots of you were waiting for, hiding or transmogging those (sometimes ugly) backpacks!
- **Extra mod compatibility.** Compatibility between the mods of the modpack has been improved heavily for a more seamless experience.
- **New HUD Health & Stamina Bars.** Goodbye Asteorbar, these new health/stamina bars are pixel perfect, hand made and look absolutely sexy.
