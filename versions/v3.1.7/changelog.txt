# Prominence II RPG: Hasturian Era
**v3.1.7 - Buffs & Fixes**

## Important Changes
- **Buffed Dark Armor**, to better fit as an upgrade of the Netherite Berserker set.
- **Fixed a crash that could potentially chunkban people or rollback servers**, when going into a chunk with a glitched structure.
- **Misc quest fixes**, and the addition of a party tutorial in the starter quests.
- **Default RAM**, thanks to a new CurseForge feature, the modpack will automatically come with the correct allocated RAM. This is not yet supported in Modrinth, remember to allocate more ram there as modrinth defaults to only 2gb!

## Changes
- Buffed Physical Damage from Dark Armor to be an actual upgrade from Netherite Berserker armor (3.75% to 5% per piece)
- Added 10% knockback resistance to all Dark Armor pieces to match Netherite Berserker.
